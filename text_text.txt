july 8th, 9:13 AM: the md didn't change when I pushed, will continue testing
july 8th, 9:17 AM: i forgot to do "git push origin main" right after i commited, haha
july 8th, 9:24 AM: made another branch called "main_child" to simulate final changes before committing into the main branch
july 9th, 12:41 AM: please don't ask why im alive right now
july 9th, 1:36 AM: after a lot of messing around and automatically merging from main to main_child, I decided to delete the main_child from the face of the digital earth
july 9th, 1:42 AM: so i went to reset the whole process and cloned the original repository instead so i can add my new branch called "main_master". let's see how this goes...
july 9th, 1:48 AM: i have successfully pushed main_master and also made a pull request into main, merging it! now let's see if there were two branches instead of one...
    - this is where "git pull" might be handy to stay up to date, but how would i use it? anyways, i'll name my new branch "captain"
july 9th, 1:59 AM: ran to an error that said " 'main_master' does not appear to be a git repository", is the solution "git push -u origin <branch-name>"?
