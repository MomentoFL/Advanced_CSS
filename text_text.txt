july 8th, 9:13 AM: the md didn't change when I pushed, will continue testing
july 8th, 9:17 AM: i forgot to do "git push origin main" right after i commited, haha
july 8th, 9:24 AM: made another branch called "main_child" to simulate final changes before committing into the main branch
july 8th, 2:20 PM: testing
july 8th, 2:27 PM: I used "git checkout main_child" to go into the branch, and then used the similar push process to add new code,
 BUT I did "git push origin main_child --force to add the new code from this branch. very interesting...
 july 8th, 2:43 PM: WHY ARENT YOU PUSHING TO MAIN????
